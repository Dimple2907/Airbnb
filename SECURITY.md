# Security Features Documentation

## Authentication System Security Enhancements

This document outlines the comprehensive security features implemented in the Wanderlust Airbnb Clone authentication system.

### 1. Rate Limiting Protection

#### Implementation
- **General Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Authentication Rate Limiting**: 5 login attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **Signup Rate Limiting**: 3 signup attempts per hour per IP
- **Username Check Rate Limiting**: 20 username checks per 5 minutes per IP

#### Benefits
- Prevents brute force attacks
- Reduces server load from automated requests
- Protects against credential stuffing attacks

### 2. Client-Side Security Features

#### Password Strength Validation
- Real-time password strength checking
- Visual strength indicators (Very Weak, Weak, Fair, Good, Strong)
- Requirements: minimum 8 characters, letters, numbers, special characters

#### Client-Side Rate Limiting
- Local storage tracking of failed login attempts
- 15-minute lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Automatic lockout timer display

#### Input Sanitization
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- HTML entity encoding for user inputs
- Validation of input formats before submission

### 3. Server-Side Security Features

#### Input Validation
- Server-side validation of all user inputs
- Username format validation (3-20 alphanumeric characters)
- Email format validation using regex
- Password complexity requirements

#### Data Sanitization
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Removal of potentially dangerous characters
- Trimming of whitespace from inputs

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed logging for security events
- Prevention of information disclosure through error messages

### 4. User Experience Security Features

#### Visual Security Indicators
- HTTPS connection status display
- Password security level indicators
- Real-time validation feedback
- Username availability checking

#### Accessibility & Security
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- High contrast mode support
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management for security elements

### 5. Authentication Flow Security

#### Secure Session Management
- Session-based authentication with Passport.js
- Secure session storage with MongoDB
- Session expiration (3 days)
- HttpOnly cookies for session security

#### Username Availability API
- Rate-limited username checking
- Secure API endpoint with validation
- Prevention of user enumeration attacks

### 6. Frontend Security Measures

#### Password Visibility Toggle
- Secure password visibility controls
- Accessibility-compliant implementation
- Icon state management

#### Form Validation
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Server-side validation for security
- CSRF protection through form tokens

### 7. Security Best Practices Implemented

#### Progressive Enhancement
- Works without JavaScript (graceful degradation)
- Enhanced features for modern browsers
- Fallback mechanisms for older browsers

#### Performance Security
- Optimized animations and transitions
- Reduced motion support for accessibility
- Efficient rate limiting with minimal overhead

### 8. Monitoring and Logging

#### Security Events Tracking
- Failed login attempt logging
- Rate limit violation tracking
- Suspicious activity detection

#### User Feedback
- Toast notifications for security events
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Success confirmations for security actions

### 9. Mobile Security

#### Responsive Security UI
- Mobile-optimized security indicators
- Touch-friendly password visibility toggles
- Proper input types for mobile keyboards

#### Performance Optimizations
- Lightweight security checks
- Efficient client-side validation
- Minimal JavaScript for core security features

### 10. Compliance and Standards

#### Accessibility Compliance
- WCAG 2.1 compliant security features
- Screen reader compatible
- Keyboard navigation support

#### Security Standards
- OWASP security guidelines compliance
- Modern authentication best practices
- Secure coding standards implementation

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
1. Always validate inputs on both client and server sides
2. Use rate limiting for all sensitive endpoints
3. Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
4. Follow the established security patterns in this codebase

### For Users
1. Use strong, unique passwords
2. Enable browser security features
3. Keep sessions secure by logging out properly
4. Report any suspicious activity

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `SECRET`: Session secret key (should be strong and unique)
- `MONGOURL`: Database connection string (should use authentication)

### Rate Limiting Configuration
All rate limiting settings can be adjusted in `/middleware/rateLimiter.js`:
- Window duration
- Maximum requests per window
- Error messages
- Skip conditions

## Future Security Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. Two-factor authentication (2FA)
2. Password reset functionality
3. Account lockout policies
4. Security audit logging
5. Captcha integration for suspicious activity

### Recommended Monitoring
1. Failed login attempt patterns
2. Rate limit trigger frequency
3. Unusual user agent patterns
4. Geographic anomalies in login attempts
